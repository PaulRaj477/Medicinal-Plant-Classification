# Requirements for Medicinal Plant Classification using EfficientNet-B3

This document lists all the dependencies required to set up the project for medicinal plant classification. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed before proceeding.

## Python Libraries
The required Python libraries can be installed using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Below is the content for `requirements.txt`:
```
tensorflow>=2.5.0
numpy>=1.19.0
matplotlib>=3.3.0
pandas>=1.1.0
scikit-learn>=0.24.0
opencv-python>=4.5.0
imageio>=2.9.0
seaborn>=0.11.0
```

## System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Processor**: x86-64 architecture with support for AVX instructions
- **RAM**: Minimum 8 GB (16 GB or more recommended)
- **GPU** (optional but recommended): NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (Compute Capability >= 3.5)
  - CUDA Toolkit 11.2 or higher
  - cuDNN 8.1 or higher

## Additional Tools
- Jupyter Notebook or an IDE like VSCode/PyCharm for code execution.
- Google Colab or similar platform for GPU-accelerated training (optional).

## Environment Setup
To create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```
2. Activate the environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Ensure the environment is correctly set up by verifying the TensorFlow installation:
```bash
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"
```

If TensorFlow is correctly installed, the version number will be displayed.

For any issues, refer to the [TensorFlow Installation Guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).
